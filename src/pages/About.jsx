            <p>Mandalart planner is also known as Mandala Chart or Mandala-art planner. It helps you organize and visualize your goal(s).</p>
            <br></br>
            <h2>How do I make one?</h2>
            <p>1) Define your goal and write it down in the center of the middle box.<br></br>2) think of the things you can do for your goal. you should write them down in the boxes around the main goal.
                <br></br>3) you should also think about and write down what you can do for each of the small goals you set. it doesn't have to be something serious or difficult to acheive. </p>
            <p></p>so if my main goal is to staying healthy, I can think about 8 specific goals for that main goal, like eating healthy, staying active, etc... and then I can add even more specific things I have to do for the small goals. for the goal, 'staying active',
            I can 'run every day' or 'learn new sports like soccer and basketball'. you can set 8 specific tasks for each small goals.
